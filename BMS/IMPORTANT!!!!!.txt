In Line 9, a variable called "directory" is used to indicate the directory of this folder, which is how the database is located. Could you please change the variable to the directory to the directory that you will be using. I have been trying different methods of code to get the current directory of the database but it keeps on directing me to "Users", when the database I want to create is within the root of the current folder. Hopefully this is not too big of an issue.
